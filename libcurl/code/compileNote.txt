If you need to have curl first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"


When compiling program, need to provide flag for lib curl header: 
gcc myfile.c -lcurl -o myprogram
